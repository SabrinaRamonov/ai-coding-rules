# AI Coding Rules

Hereâ€™s how I use Claude Code, the ultimate AI coding tool, to implement new features in an existing complex codebase with many users. This is not a vibe coding tutorial building throwaway MVPs.

This AI coding guide is for software developers who want to improve their daily AI coding workflows, maintain a clean production-grade codebase, and reduce bugs introduced by AI.

You need to be hands-on involved, push back on AI plans, stop it from going down the wrong rabbit hole, question the code, and test extensively.
